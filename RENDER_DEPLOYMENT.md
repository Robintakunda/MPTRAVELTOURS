# Hosting on Render

This project is configured for easy deployment on Render using the `render.yaml` file provided.

## Prerequisites
1. A [Render](https://render.com) account.
2. Your project pushed to a GitHub or GitLab repository.

## Important Note on Free Plans
Render requires payment information on file for some regions or account types even when using free plans.
- If you see a payment request, you may need to provide details to Render.
- Alternatively, you can try setting up the Web Service and PostgreSQL database manually on Render selecting the **Free** tier for each to see if it bypasses the requirement.

## Deployment Steps
1. In your Render Dashboard, click **New +** and select **Blueprint**.
2. Connect your repository.
3. Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file and set up:
   - A Node.js Web Service (Free Tier).
   - A PostgreSQL Database (Free Tier).
4. **Important**: You must manually add your `RESEND_API_KEY` in the Render Dashboard:
   - Go to your Web Service settings.
   - Navigate to **Environment**.
   - Add a new secret with the key `RESEND_API_KEY` and your actual API key as the value.

## Environment Variables
The following variables are automatically handled or need manual setup:
- `DATABASE_URL`: Automatically linked to the created PostgreSQL instance.
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Automatically generated by Render.
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to `production`.
- `RESEND_API_KEY`: **Manual setup required**.
